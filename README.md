# Athena V0.1

If you're a student in India, you've probably had struggles with consolidating your achievements and awards and finding events that you can attend, based on your interests. 

By this project, we hope to create a space for budding young minds in order to get as much exposure as possible and to also provide them with a space where they can consolidate their achievements. 

If you have any concerns or have any suggestions as to how we can do better, do let us know at

1. Open two different terminals
2. Navigate to the frontend folder in one terminal, and the backend folder in another terminal 
3. In the frontend terminal, run the following commands

## INFO ON BRAIN.JS
Before installation, try to update npm to its latest version by 
```
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
```

It should, theoretically, do the trick. If it does not, then you will have to compile the brain.js libraries yourself before deployment
